# JTX

This is my long term offline phyiscally-based ray tracer (building it as I go through Physically Based Rendering, 4th edition)

Current progress is being written in these repositories:
 - [JTXLib](https://github.com/jebikoh/jtxlib)
 - [Ray Tracing](https://github.com/jebikoh/raytracing)
 - [Cuda Ray Tracing](https://github.com/jebikoh/cudart)
