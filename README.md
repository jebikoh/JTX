# JTX

Writing an improved version of my [TGE](https://github.com/jebikoh/tge) project in C++. 

A (hopefully) real-time software renderer in C++ 

Uses a RHS coordinate system. Data is tentatively stored in a row-major format. Check [here](https://github.com/jebikoh/JTX/blob/main/tests/test_buffer.cpp#L108) for sample usage.

Extrenal dependencies are:
 - OpenBLAS
 - fpng (included)
